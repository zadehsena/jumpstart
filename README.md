What is Phishing? 

Phishing attacks collect sensitive information such as login credentials, credit card numbers, bank account details, posing as a trusted source. A typical example of a phishing scam is the use of email spoofing to disguise itself as a trusted source, suchas a financial institution, to trick the target into downloading an infected attachment or clicking a malicious link. Phishing emails usually create a sense of urgency so that the victim feels that it is important to disclose information quickly. Despite being a relatively straightforward attack, phishing is one of the biggest cybersecurity risks.

Phishing is a broad term used to describe the fraudulent acquisition of information, often focused on credentials like usernames and passwords, as well as sensitive personal information like credit card numbers and related data.
